# Moods

The idea is that I want to have a place where, if you’re having a hard time, you can come to 'moods' and share what’s got you in a mood- share a gif that exemplifies your mood, post a picture - and get support (ideally) from the commenters.

# Getting Started

To create this app, I used wireframes and ERDs (pictured below) as well as a Trello board (pictured below) as guides to help me establish and meet my goals. To deploy this app, you will need to open a coding program and install all required programs and set up Google Oath credentials.

# Inspiration

I was inspired by conversations I've had with classmates who needed a person who could listen and hear their pain and stress. I know that a lot of people don't have a person like that in their lives so I wanted to build a place where they could go and get that support.

# Unsolved Problems

I was able to have full CRUD functionality on my moods (posts), but was not able to add the same functionality to my comments. I planned on
